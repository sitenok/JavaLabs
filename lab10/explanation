Using a Hash Set to store a list of countries, using the iterator function.
Learning to use existing methods and functions for Hash Sets/ creating more methods.
Populating a Hash Set with elements of an existing array (asList). 
Array called countries, HashSet called europe.

1. Printing the Hash set using an iterator object. 
2. Add an entry to the Hash set. = 
    HashSet.add(input)
3. Matching input to an element in the hash set (true/false) = 
    if(HashSet.contains(input))
4. Clearing a set. = 
    europe.clear();
5. Sorting contents of Hash Set by creating a temp ArrayList & populating with HashSet elements( ArrayList<String> tempArray = new ArrayList<String>(europe); )
    = to use the Collections.sort() function. 
   Shuffling contents in the same way 
    = Collections.reverse(tempArray);
   Showing reverse of the hash set
    = Collections.reverse(tempArray);
